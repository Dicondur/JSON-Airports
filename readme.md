# JSON Airports

At [Blue Bay Travel](http://bluebaytravel.co.uk) we needed a list of Airports and their basic informations to provide autocompletion within our internal applications. We searched high and low to find something, but only had a MySQL table from somewhere, so we created this file.

The JSON file, airports.json contains an array of airports and some basic information, incliding:
- Name
- IATA code
- Location
